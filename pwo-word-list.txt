#  This list was created to aid in word wrapping issues. It aims to
#  be an exhaustive list of all words in Pwo Karen. Contributions
#  are welcome.
#
#  For purposes of this word list, I define a word as a string of
#  syllabes where, if it were broken at any point, the resultant
#  parts would have either no meaning or an entirely unrelated
#  meaning.
